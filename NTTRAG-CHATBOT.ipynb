As of 2009, an estimated  0.1 percent of adults age 15 to 49 were living with  HIV or acquired immune deficiency syndrome  (AIDS).  Health Care Personnel Turkmenistan has one medical school, Turkmen Dru\\xad zbi Narodov Medical Institute in Ashkhabat, which  has been offering instruction since 1932. In 2007,  Turkmenistan had 2.44 physicians per 1,000 popula\\xad tion, 0.20 pharmaceutical personnel per 1,000, 0.14  dentistry personnel per 1,000, and 4.52 nurses and  midwives per 1,000. Government Role in Health Care According to WHO, in 2010, Turkmenistan spent  $535 million on health care, an amount that comes  to $106 per capita. All health care funding came from  domestic sources. The largest share of health care  spending was provided through government expen\\xad ditures (59 percent), with the remainder coming from  household expenditures (41 percent). In 2010, Turk\\xad menistan allocated 10 percent of its total government  expenditures to health, in the high range for lower- middle-income European countries; government  expenditures on health came to 1 percent of GDP,  in the low range for lower-middle-income European  countries. In 2009, according to WHO, official devel\\xad opment assistance (ODA) for health in Turkmenistan  came to $0.57 per capita.  Public Health Programs In 2005, 98 percent of the population in Turkmenistan  had access to improved sanitation facilities (97 percent  in rural areas and 99 percent in urban), and 84 percent  had access to improved sources of drinking water (72  percent in rural areas and 97 percent in urban). TUVALU Tuvalu is an island nation in the south Pacific Ocean;  the area of 10 square miles (26 square kilometers)  makes it about one-tenth the size of Washington,  D.C., and one of the smallest independent countries  in the world. The July 2012 population was estimated  at 10,169, the smallest in the United Nations (UN);  Funafuti is the capital. In 2010, 50 percent of the  population lived in urban areas, and the 2010 to 2015  annual rate of urbanization was estimated at 1.4 per\\xad cent. The population growth rate in 2012 was 0.7 per\\xad cent, the net migration rate negative 7.0 migrants per  1,000 population, the birth rate 23.4 births per 1,000,  and the total fertility rate 3.1 children per woman.  Tuvalu became in independent country in 1978;  it was previously a British colony called the Ellice  Islands and had also been part of the Gilbert and  Ellice Islands (citizens of the Ellice Islands voted to  separate from the Gilbert Islands in 1974). Because  Tuvalu is composed of coral atolls, it is extremely  sensitive to changes in sea level, and potable water  must be collected through catchment systems or pro\\xad duced by desalination; almost all food and fuel must  be imported, and Tuvalu receives much of its income  from remittances, licensing of the Internet domain  name “. tv,” and income from a trust fund supported  by Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and South Korea.  Life expectancy at birth in 2012 was estimated at 65.11  years, and estimated gross domestic product (GDP)  per capita in 2011 was $3,400. Emergency Health Services According to the World Health Organization (WHO),  as of 2007, Tuvalu had a formal and publicly available  emergency care (prehospital care) system accessible  through a national access number. Insurance Tuvalu provides free health care services to its citi\\xad zens; most care is provided through government  institutions, while specialized care is provided by  visiting teams of physicians and through referral to  overseas care.  Costs of Hospitalization No data available. Access to Health Care According to WHO, in 2007, 97.9 percent of births in  Tuvalu were attended by skilled personnel (for exam\\xad ple, physicians, nurses, or midwives), and 67 percent  of pregnant women received at least four prenatal care  visits. The 2010 immunization rates for 1-year-olds  were 89 percent for diphtheria and pertussis (DPT3),'},\n",

The course of training for the basic medical degree  lasts six or seven years, and the degree awarded is the  Docteur en Médecine (doctor of medicine), with the  license to practice medicine granted by the Ministère  de la Santé de la Population.  In 2007, Algeria had 1.21 physicians per 1,000  population, 0.24 pharmaceutical personnel per 1,000,  0.33 dentistry personnel per 1,000, 0.03 community  and traditional health workers per 1,000, and 1.95  nurses and midwives per 1,000. The global “brain  drain” (international migration of skilled personnel)  plays a role in this relative undersupply of medical  personnel in Algeria: Michael Clemens and Bunilla  Petterson estimate that 44 percent of Algerian-born  physicians and 9 percent of Algerian-born nurses are  working in one of nine developed countries, primar\\xad ily in France.  Government Role in Health Care According to WHO, in 2010, Algeria spent $6.3 bil\\xad lion on health care, or $178 per capita. The Algerian  health care system is funded entirely domestically,  with the government funding over three-quarters  (78 percent) of health care expenditures; households  purchase 21 percent of the total, with the remaining  1 percent being purchased by other entities. Govern\\xad ment and total spending on health have increased in  recent years, while out-of-pocket household spending  has remained fairly constant. In 2010, about 8 per\\xad cent of government resources were allocated to health  care. Compared to other upper-middle-income Afri\\xad can countries, Algeria ranks low in terms of total  government expenditure on health as a percent of  gross domestic product (GDP) and share of govern\\xad ment spending allocated to health. In 2009, according  to WHO, official development assistance (ODA) for  health in Algeria came to $0.33 per capita.  Public Health Programs According to WHO, in 2007, Algeria had 0.07 envi\\xad ronmental and public health workers per 1,000 pop\\xad ulation. As of 2010, access to improved sanitation  facilities (95 percent) and improved drinking water  sources (83 percent) was common, although not uni\\xad versal; access to both was lower in rural than in urban  areas, with only 88 percent of people in rural areas  having access to improved sanitation facilities and 79  percent to improved drinking water sources. Accord\\xad ing to C. B. Ijsselmuiden and colleagues, in 2007,  Algeria had four institutions offering postgraduate  public health programs.  ANDORRA Andorra is a mountainous, landlocked southwestern  European country sharing borders with France and  Spain. It is one of the smallest countries in Europe,  with a total area of 181 square miles (468 square kilo\\xad meters, about 2.5 times the size of Washington, D.C.)  and population (2012 estimate) of 85,082. In 2010, 88  percent of the population lived in urban areas, and the  2010 to 2015 annual rate of urbanization is estimated  at 1.1 percent. The capital and largest city is Andorra  La Vella (with a 2009 population estimated at 25,000).  The population growth rate in 2012 was 0.3 percent,  the birth rate 9.3 births per 1,000 population, the net  migration rate 0.0 migrants per 1,000, and the total  fertility rate 1.4 children per woman, among the 20  lowest rates in the world.  Until 1993, Andorra was ruled as a coprincipality  of Spain and France; in 1993, it became a parliamen\\xad tary democracy. In 2011, Andorra was classified as  a country with very high human development (the  highest of four categories) on the United Nations  Development  Programme’s  (UNDP’s)  Human  Development Index (HDI), with a score of 0.838 (on  a scale where 1 denotes high development and 0 low  development).

MSF treated 249 patients in a cholera outbreak  in Zinder and cleaned four wells to keep the disease  from spreading further. Insurance Niger has a social insurance system covering mater\\xad nity benefits only. The system is funded through  employer contributions (8.4 percent of payroll) and is  part of the same system that provides Family Benefits.  Employers are required to provide certain medical  services, but there are no statutory medical benefits  other than maternity care. The cash maternity benefit  is 100 percent of earnings, paid for six weeks before  and eight weeks after the due date; an additional three  weeks may be added if there are complications. The  Family Benefits system provides a prenatal allowance  of CFAR 1,000 per month and a maternity allowance  paid as a lump sum of CFAR 10,000, and a birth allow\\xad ance of CFAR 10,000 is paid for the first three births;  receipt of these benefits requires that the woman  undergo prescribed medical exams. The Family Bene\\xad fits system also pays a family allowance of CFAR 1,000  per month per child until the child is 14 (extended to  18 for an apprentice and 21 if disabled or a student).  The system is administered by the National Social  Security Fund under the general supervision of the  Ministry of Public Administration and Labor.  Costs of Hospitalization No data available. Access to Health Care According to WHO, in 2006, 33 percent of births in  Niger were attended by skilled personnel (for exam\\xad ple, physicians, nurses, or midwives), and 15 percent  of pregnant women received at least four prenatal care  visits. The 2010 immunization rates for 1-year-olds  were 70 percent for diphtheria and pertussis (DPT3),  71 percent for measles (MCV), and 70 percent for  Hib (Hib3). In 2010, an estimated 29 percent of per\\xad sons with advanced human immunodeficiency virus  (HIV) infection were receiving antiretroviral therapy  in accordance with the 2010 WHO guidelines. Cost of Drugs Total pharmaceutical expenses in 2009 in Niger  came to XOF 32,747 million ($70.3 million), or XOF  2,153.30 ($4.60) per capita. Pharmaceutical expendi\\xad tures constituted 32.9 percent of total health spending,  and 1.3 percent of GDP. Most pharmaceutical expen\\xad ditures were paid for privately, with public expendi\\xad tures forming 5.6 percent of the total. Niger’s National  Medicines Policy (NMP) includes selection of drugs  for placement on the Essential Medicines List (EML),  and the right to access essential medicines and medical  technologies is specified in national legislation as part  of the right to health.  Medications are provided for free to children under  the age of 5, pregnant women, and the poor. Medica\\xad tions to treat tuberculosis and human immunode\\xad ficiency virus and acquired immune deficiency syn\\xad drome (HIV/AIDS) are provided for free, as are the  vaccines included on WHO’s Expanded Programme  for Immunization (EPI) list.  Health Care Facilities As of 2010, according to WHO, Niger had 16.07 health  posts per 100,000 population, 5.71 health centers per  100,000, 0.50 district or rural hospitals per 100,000,  0.07 provincial hospitals per 100,000, and 0.06 spe\\xad cialized hospitals per 100,000. In 2005, Niger had 0.31  hospital beds per 1,000 population, one of the 10 low\\xad est rates in the world. Major Health Issues In 2008, WHO estimated that 90 percent of years of  life lost in Niger were due to communicable diseases,  8 percent to noncommunicable diseases, and 3 percent  to injuries.

Life expectancy at birth in 2012 was estimated  at 72.77 years, and estimated gross domestic product  (GDP) per capita in 2011 was $3,300. In 2003, the  Gini Index (a measure of dispersion, in which perfect  equality is denoted by 0 and maximum inequality is  denoted by 100) for family income was 36.8. Emergency Health Services According to the World Health Organization  (WHO), as of 2007, Uzbekistan had a formal and  publicly available emergency care (prehospital care)  system accessible through a national access number.  Doctors Without Borders (Médecins Sans Frontières,  or MSF) began working in Uzbekistan in 1997 and  had 117 staff members in the country at the close of  2010. MSF’s primary focus is diagnosis and treatment  of drug-resistant tuberculosis, and it currently pro\\xad vides care in four districts; MSF also provides social  and psychological counseling for family members  of tuberculosis patients and promotes innovative  approaches to tuberculosis treatment and care. MSF  also provided counseling and relief to refugees from  the conflict in Kyrgyzstan.  Insurance Uzbekistan has a universal medical system covering  everyone residing in the country and a social insur\\xad ance system providing cash sickness and maternity  benefits. The medical benefits system is entirely  funded by general tax revenues, while the cash ben\\xad efits system is part of the same system that provides  pensions and is financed through contributions  from wages (4 percent), self-employed income (at  least the same amount as a person earning the mini\\xad mum wage), and employers (25 percent of payroll);  the government covers the cost of social pensions  and makes up deficits. Medical benefits are provided  directly through government health care providers;  benefits include hospitalization, medical care, medi\\xad cines, and prostheses.  The maternity benefit is 100 percent of wages for 70  days before and 56 days after childbirth, with exten\\xad sions for multiple births or complications. Mothers  remaining at home to care for children younger than  age 2 are entitled to paid leave (20 percent of wages)  and unpaid leave to care for a child between the ages  of 2 and 3. The sickness benefit is 60 to 100 percent of  wages, depending on the length of employment and  number of children. The Ministry of Health and local  health departments provide medical services through  government hospitals, clinics, and other facilities; the  Extrabudgetary Pension Fund administers the mater\\xad nity benefits; the Department of Social Protection  pays the cash benefits, and the system is coordinated  and supervised by the Ministry of Labor and Social  Protections.  Costs of Hospitalization No data available. Access to Health Care According to WHO, in 2006, 100 percent of births in  Uzbekistan were attended by skilled personnel (for  example, physicians, nurses, or midwives). The 2010  immunization rates for 1-year-olds were 99 percent  for diphtheria and pertussis (DPT3), 98 percent  for measles (MCV), and 99 percent for Hib (Hib3).  In 2010, an estimated 28 percent of persons with  advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)  infection were receiving antiretroviral therapy in  accordance with the 2010 WHO guidelines. Cost of Drugs According to WHO, in 2004, the median availabil\\xad ity of selected generic drugs in the private sector in  Uzbekistan was 82.5 percent; the median price ratio  (comparing the price in Uzbekistan to the interna\\xad tional reference price) was 2.0 in the private sphere  for selected generic medicines, indicating that median  prices in the public sphere were twice as high as the  international reference price. Health Care Facilities In 2007, Uzbekistan had 4.83 hospital beds per 1,000  population, among the 50 highest rates in the world. Major Health Issues In 2008, WHO estimated that 34 percent of years of  life lost in Uzbekistan were due to communicable dis\\xad eases, 55 percent to noncommunicable diseases, and  10 percent to injuries. In 2008, the age-standardized  estimate of cancer deaths was 77 per 100,000 for men  and 66 per 100,000 for women; for cardiovascular dis\\xad ease and diabetes, 718 per 100,000 for men and 564  per 100,000 for women; and for chronic respiratory  disease, 33 per 100,000 for men and 22 per 100,000  for women.

PANAMA Panama is a Central American country, sharing bor\\xad ders with Costa Rica and Colombia and having coast\\xad lines on the Caribbean Sea and the north Pacific  Ocean. The area of 29,120 square miles (75,420 square  kilometers) makes Panama about the size of South  Carolina, and the July 2012 population was estimated  at 3.5 million. In 2010, 75 percent of the population  lived in urban areas, and the 2010 to 2015 annual rate  of urbanization was estimated at 2.3 percent. Panama  City is the capital and largest city (with a 2009 popula\\xad tion estimated at 1.3 million). The population growth  rate in 2012 was 1.4 percent, the net migration rate  negative 0.4 migrants per 1,000 population, the birth  rate 19.2 births per 1,000, and the total fertility rate  12.4 children per woman. The United Nations High  Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimated  that, in 2010, there were 3,967 refugees and persons in  refugee-like situations in Panama. Panama was colo\\xad nized by Spain in the 16th century. In 1821, Panama  joined the Union of Gran Colombia (with Colom\\xad bia, Ecuador, and Venezuela) and remained part of  Colombia when the union dissolved in 1830. Panama  seceded from Colombia in 1903 and signed a treaty  allowing the United States to construct the Panama  Canal; the Panama Canal Zone, the area around the  Panama Canal, was U.S. territory until it was trans\\xad ferred back to Panama in 1999. Panama ranked tied  for 86th among 183 countries on the Corruption Per\\xad ceptions Index 2011, with a score of 3.3 (on a scale  where 0 indicates highly corrupt and 10 very clean). In 2011, Panama was classified as a country with  high human development (the second-highest cat\\xad egory) on the United Nations Development Pro\\xad gramme’s (UNDP’s) Human Development Index  (HDI), with a score of 0.768 (on a scale where 1  denotes high development and 0 low development).  Life expectancy at birth in 2012 was estimated at 77.96  years, and per capita gross domestic product (GDP) in  2011 was estimated at $13,600. Income distribution in  Panama is relatively unequal: In 2010, the Gini Index  (a measure of dispersion, in which perfect equality is  denoted by 0 and maximum inequality is denoted by  100) for family income was estimated at 51.9, among  the 20 highest in the world.

Major Health Issues In 2008, WHO estimated that 35 percent of years of  life lost in Paraguay were due to communicable dis\\xad eases, 45 percent to noncommunicable diseases, and  21 percent to injuries. In 2008, the age-standardized  estimate of cancer deaths was 133 per 100,000 for men  and 98 per 100,000 for women; for cardiovascular dis\\xad ease and diabetes, 269 per 100,000 for men and 228  per 100,000 for women; and for chronic respiratory  disease, 24 per 100,000 for men and 10 per 100,000  for women.  Paraguay’s maternal mortality rate (death from  any cause related to or aggravated by pregnancy) was  estimated in 2008 as 95 maternal deaths per 100,000  live births. The infant mortality rate, defined as the  number of deaths of infants younger than 1 year, was  estimated at 22.24 per 1,000 live births as of 2012. In  2010, tuberculosis incidence was 46.0 per 100,000  population, tuberculosis prevalence 64.0 per 100,000,  and deaths due to tuberculosis among HIV-negative  people 4.20 per 100,000. As of 2009, an estimated 0.3  percent of adults age 15 to 49 were living with HIV or  acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).  Health Care Personnel As of 2007, Paraguay had four medical schools. The  basic medical degree course lasts six years, and the  degree awarded is Médico Cirujano (physician and  surgeon). In 2002, Paraguay had 1.11 physicians per  1,000 population, 0.33 pharmaceutical personnel  per 1,000, 0.55 dentistry personnel per 1,000, 1.15  community and traditional health workers per 1,000,  and 1.79 nurses and midwives per 1,000.  Government Role in Health Care According to WHO, in 2010, Paraguay spent $1.1 bil\\xad lion on health care, an amount that comes to $163 per  capita. Most (98 percent) health care funding came  from domestic sources, with 2 percent coming from  sources from abroad. More than half (57 percent) of  health care spending was paid for through household  expenditures, with the remainder provided through  government expenditures (36 percent) and other  sources (7 percent). In 2010, Paraguay allocated 11  percent of its total government expenditures to  health, and government expenditures on health came  to 2 percent of GDP; both figures are in the low range  for lower-middle-income Americas region countries.  In 2009, according to WHO, official development  assistance (ODA) for health in Paraguay came to  $3.63 per capita. Public Health Programs According to WHO, in 2002, Paraguay had 0.02 envi\\xad ronmental and public health workers per 1,000 pop\\xad ulation. In 2010, 71 percent of the population had  access to improved sanitation facilities (40 percent  in rural areas and 90 percent in urban), and 86 per\\xad cent had access to improved sources of drinking water  (66 percent in rural areas and 99 percent in urban).  According to the World Higher Education Database  (WHED), two universities in Paraguay offer programs  in epidemiology or public health: the National Uni\\xad versity of Asuncion, and the University of the Integra\\xad tion of the Americas in Asuncion.

According to WHO, in 2007, 100 percent of births in Barbados were attended by skilled person\\xad nel (for example, physicians, nurses, or midwives). In 2007, 100 percent of pregnant women received at least one prenatal care visit. The 2010 immunization rates for 1-year-olds were 86 percent for diphtheria and pertussis (DPT3), 85 percent for measles (MCV), and 86 percent for Hib (Hib3). Cost of Drugs The Barbados Drug Service obtains essential drugs from a local manufacturer and from sources in Europe, South America, the United States, and Canada. Barba\\xad dos maintains a national Drug Formulary, and some medications are provided free to children under age 16, persons over age 65, and for treatment of asthma, cancer, diabetes, epilepsy, and hypertension. Vaccines are purchased through the Pan American Health Orga\\xad nization’s (PAHO’s) Revolving Fund for Vaccine Pro\\xad curement. From 2004 to 2005, Barbados spent $11.7 million providing drug benefits to the population. Health Care Facilities Queen Elizabeth Hospital, located in Bridgetown, is the main hospital in Barbados and is also the teaching hospital for the Cave Hill Campus of the University of the West Indies. In 2008, Barbados had 7.60 hospital beds per 1,000 population, the 10th-highest ratio in the world.',\n",

Medicines are covered at 70 percent and are provided free to those on social assistance. Pediatric health care is provided until age 5 and includes child development programs, health care, and nutrition programs.
